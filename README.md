An Introduction to Data Science Project

## Intro
Online review has been a very useful tool for online marketing. It is one of the unique features of online marketing and online shopping that you cannot experience from physical shopping. Online product reviews enable more diversified opinions that will give consumers different opinions regarding the product. It is also made easily accessible by consumers. 

The weakness of online shopping, however, is that the buyers wonâ€™t be able to physically access the product before purchasing. Some consumers might wish to touch or try
the product before purchasing. Especially beauty products, where you need to take a closer look or try the product. A study from Facebook for Business (Facebook IQ, 2018) shows that the majority of consumers still discover new products in physical stores and rely more on physical stores. 

Because of these, we set out to find the importance and effectiveness of product review and their contribution or impact (whether there is any) towards the sales of beauty
products. We identified the core attributes that we are going to use from the data set are mainly the reviews from consumers and sales rank. We are also interested to find out the correlation between high rating reviews and the sales of the beauty products.
